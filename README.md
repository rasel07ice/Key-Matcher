## FAQ

#### What is ES6 and what are the new features introduced in ES6?

ES6 is the 6th and major edition of the ECMAScript language which is introduced in 2015. The main purpose of ES6 is to write less, do more.
New Features of ES6:
1.	let and const Keywords
2.	Arrow Functions
3.	Multi-line Strings
4.	Default Parameters
5.	Template Literals
6.	DE structuring Assignment
7.	Enhanced Object Literals
8.	Promises
9.	Classes
10.	Modules


#### What is Event Delegation?

Event delegation is a pattern based upon Event Bubbling. With this pattern, instead of adding event listeners to every child element, you only need to bind the event listener to the parent element.
Due to event bubbling, event triggered on the child elements will bubble up to the parent element.
JavaScript event delegation benefits

•	Less memory usage, better performance and prevent memory leak.

•	Less time is required to set up event handlers on the page.

### What is Event Bubbling?
Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It refers to this scenario: an element receives an event, and this event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it reaches the root element.
For example, when you click the button, the click event will bubble up to the root element.

### What is Local Storage?
This read-only interface property provides access to the document’s local storage object; the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends—that is, when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).

### What is Session Storage?
Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.
### What is Cookie?
The term “cookie” refers to just the textual information about a website. In order to recognize you and show you results according to your preferences, this website saves some information in your local system when you visit a particular website. The history of the internet has long been marked by the use of cookies. A website visitor asks the server for a web page when they visit it. Every request for a server is unique. Likewise, if you visit a hundred times, each request will be considered unique by the server. Since a server receives many requests every second, storing every user’s information on a server doesn’t seem logical and obvious. The same information may not be needed again if you don’t return. Therefore, a cookie is sent and stored on your local machine to uniquely identify you. You will receive a response from the same server the next time you hit it since it recognizes you. Almost every server uses this cookie (some exceptions exist today because of advertisements). Therefore, although you might have many cookies in your system, such cookies will be recognized by a server and analyzed.

### What are the new features in CSS3?
There are few new features of CSS3
- Advanced Animations and Transitions
We can utilise both Transition and Animation when changing a component starting with one state and moving/transitioning to the next. What matters is that animation can comprise numerous states, giving command over its animation. These animations are now available and compatible with all browsers. 
There are two different ways to make CSS animations. The first is to animate the progressions of CSS properties by declaring transition. You can make a float or mouse-down effect with transitions or trigger the animation by changing a component's style with JavaScript.
The second way of characterising animations is more complex. It includes the portrayal of specific moments of the animation along with the code. This enables you to have recurring animations that don't rely upon user activities or JavaScript to get activated.
- Multiple Backgrounds & Gradient
Another prominent CSS 3 feature is the support for multiple backgrounds and gradients. With this, creators can accomplish extremely intriguing impacts. They can stack various pictures as backgrounds of a component. Each picture (or layer) can be moved and animated effortlessly. Gradients enable website specialists to make smooth advances between hues without turning to pictures. CSS gradients likewise look extraordinary on retina displays since they are created when the page loads. They can be straight or outspread and can be set to repeat.
- Multiple Column layouts
This CSS3 feature incorporates properties to enable web designers to display their content in multiple sections with alternatives like column-width, column-gap, and column-count. Column-based formats were previously hard to pull off in CSS. It normally included utilising JavaScript or server-side processing that parts the content into various components. This is superfluously convoluted and wastes valuable development time. Luckily, there is a route around this by utilising the CSS columns rule with CSS3.
- Opacity
This property can make web page components more transparent. Set the opacity of a picture in a picture manager or photo editing software and save it as a .png or .gif document with opacity enabled. Or on the other hand, you can get this done with a single line of code in CSS. It's up to you. The opacity ranges from 0 (totally transparent) to 1 (totally opaque).
- Rounded Corner
Greatly utilised by the social media giant Twitter, rounded corner, one of the CSS3 new properties, is already very renowned on the web. Rounded corner components can tidy up a site; however, making a rounded corner requires a web designer to compose a great deal of code. Modifying these components' stature, width, and location is an endless task because any content adjustment can break them.  
CSS 3 simplifies this issue by presenting the rounded corner property, which gives you the equivalent rounded corner impact, and you don't need to compose all the code. Truly, rounded corners look more appealing and easily used than square boxes. The best part is you can apply this effect to HTML components. That is why you'll discover rounded corners all over the web.
- Selectors
Selectors enable web designers to choose increasingly precise degrees of the website page. They are basic pseudo-classes that perform halfway matches to assist in coordinating with crediting and trait esteems. New selectors focus on a pseudo-class to style the components focused on the URL. Likewise, selectors incorporate a checked pseudo-class to style checked elements, such as checkboxes and radio buttons.
- Font Flexibility
Font flexibility refers to the ability to dynamically adjust the font size and spacing to fit on the screen without compromising the readability of the text. This is very important in the case of responsive websites, as they need to adapt to devices of different screen sizes. 
A few CSS3 properties that enable font flexibility are font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, and word-spacing. Using the combination of these properties, web designers can create a flexible typography system that can fit into the available space on the screen. 
- Word Wrapping
Another new feature is word wrapping. It breaks and wraps long words and strings of characters onto the next line if they exceed the container's width. Again this feature is beneficial in responsive websites, as they need to accommodate different screen sizes. 
Modern browsers automatically enable word wrapping. You can control it using word-wrap and overflow-wrap CSS3 properties. The word-wrap property determines whether words can break or not at arbitrary points within the word. The overflow-wrap property determines whether the words can break within themselves.
With word wrapping, you can prevent malicious users from making your blog look bad and messy. 
- Transforming Elements
As the name suggests, transforming elements implies changing their position, size, and orientation on a web page. Transformations are essential to creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces, transitions, and animations. A few essential functions used for transformations include translate, rotate, scale, skew, and transform-origin. 
- Text Shadowing
With this feature, you can add shadows to the text in HTML elements. It adds visual interest and depth to the text, making it stand out on a web page. With the text-shadow property, you can define four parameters – offset X, offset Y, blur radius, and color.
